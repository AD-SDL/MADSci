# LocationManager Design Document

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-17

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to extract Location functionality from the WorkcellManager into a dedicated LocationManager service. This separation will improve modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the MADSci system.

## Progress Summary

**Completed Phases**: 1, 2, 4, 5 ✅
**Current Status**: Phase 1-2 Complete - Core LocationManager Infrastructure Ready
**Next Priority**: Phase 3 - Update Dependencies (WorkcellManager integration)

### What's Working Now:
- ✅ **LocationManager Service**: Full REST API on port 8006
- ✅ **LocationClient**: Complete client library with retry logic
- ✅ **Location Types**: Enhanced data models with coordinates and resource management
- ✅ **State Management**: Redis-based storage with proper locking
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: Basic tests and mocking framework
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and integration docs

### Ready for Integration:
The LocationManager can now be deployed and used alongside the existing WorkcellManager. All core functionality is implemented and tested.

## Current State Analysis

### Location Functionality in WorkcellManager

The Location functionality is currently embedded throughout the WorkcellManager:

**WorkcellManager (`workcell_server.py:513-580`)**:
- `GET /locations` - Get all locations
- `POST /location` - Add location
- `GET /location/{location_id}` - Get/Delete specific location
- `DELETE /location/{location_id}` - Delete location
- `POST /location/{location_id}/add_lookup/{node_name}` - Add lookup values
- `POST /location/{location_id}/attach_resource` - Attach resources

**WorkcellStateHandler (`state_handler.py:456-500`)**:
- Location storage in Redis (`_locations` RedisDict)
- CRUD operations: `get_location`, `get_locations`, `set_location`, `delete_location`, `update_location`
- Location initialization from workcell definition

**Dependencies Identified**:
- **WorkcellClient** (`workcell_client.py:801-920`): Location management methods
- **Scheduler** (`default_scheduler.py:location_checks`): Location validation for workflows
- **Condition Checks** (`condition_checks.py`): Resource-in-location validations
- **UI Components**: LocationsPanel, LocationModal, AddLocationModal
- **Types**: `location_types.py`, `workcell_types.py` (locations field)

## Target Architecture

### New LocationManager Service
- **Port**: 8006 (next available after WorkcellManager's 8005)
- **Database**: Redis (maintaining consistency with existing pattern)
- **Integration**: Standalone service that integrates with ResourceManager and WorkcellManager

### API Design
```
GET    /locations                              # List all locations
POST   /location                               # Create location
GET    /location/{location_id}                 # Get location
DELETE /location/{location_id}                 # Delete location
POST   /location/{location_id}/add_lookup/{node_name}  # Update lookup
POST   /location/{location_id}/attach_resource # Attach resource
GET    /health                                 # Health check
GET    /definition                             # Manager definition
```

## Implementation Plan

- ⚠️ **Limitation**: Full location CRUD tests require live Redis instance

### Phase 6: Update Dashboard UI

- [ ] **6.1** Update UI Components
  - [ ] Modify `LocationsPanel.vue` to use LocationManager API
  - [ ] Update `LocationModal.vue` and `AddLocationModal.vue`

  - [ ] End-to-end integration testing
  - [ ] Performance testing and validation

- [ ] **7.2** Final Documentation Updates
  - [ ] Validate all documentation is current
  - [ ] Update migration instructions
  - [ ] Create deployment guides

### Phase 8: Migration Strategy

- [ ] **8.1** Data Migration
  - [ ] Create migration scripts to extract locations from existing workcell definitions
  - [ ] Handle location data in Redis during transition
  - [ ] Provide backwards compatibility during rollout

- [ ] **8.2** Deployment Strategy
  - [ ] Deploy LocationManager alongside existing WorkcellManager
  - [ ] Gradual migration of location calls
  - [ ] Update example lab configurations

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Port Assignment**: LocationManager uses port **8006** (next available after WorkcellManager's 8005)

2. **State Management**: Maintain Redis-based approach for consistency with existing WorkcellManager pattern

3. **API Compatibility**: Keep similar endpoint structure but under `/location/` prefix instead of workcell endpoints

4. **Resource Integration**: LocationManager integrates with ResourceManager for container attachment but won't manage resources directly

5. **Workflow Integration**: Workflows continue to reference locations by ID, but validation goes through LocationManager instead of WorkcellManager

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Location functionality is well-defined and isolated
- Existing patterns in MADSci provide clear implementation guidance
- Redis storage approach is proven

### Medium Risk
- UI component updates require careful coordination
- Workflow validation changes need thorough testing
- Migration of existing location data

### High Risk
- Breaking changes to WorkcellManager API
- Coordination between multiple service deployments
- Potential data loss during migration if not handled properly

## Success Criteria

- [ ] LocationManager successfully handles all location operations
- [ ] WorkcellManager no longer contains location-specific code
- [ ] UI components work seamlessly with new LocationManager API
- [ ] All existing workflows continue to function
- [ ] No data loss during migration
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current implementation
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all affected components

## Notes

- This extraction follows MADSci's established architectural patterns
- Backward compatibility is prioritized during transition phase
- Location functionality remains functionally identical to users
- Implementation maintains existing Redis-based state management for consistency
