    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you should understand how to define and use a MADSci `ExperimentApplication` to manage data, resources, logging and workflows for you scientific applications. You'll also learn how the built-in client management through `MadsciClientMixin` simplifies interaction with all MADSci manager services."

    "\n",
    "The MADSci software architecture uses a number of modular components, called managers, to organize the workflows, resources and datapoints that we will use to actually do science. In order to interface with the manager, we provide clients with predefined functions that make the manager functionality easy to understand and use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExperimentApplication` class provided by MADSci:\n",
    "- Inherits from `RestNode` (and thus `MadsciClientMixin`) providing automatic client management\n",
    "- Leverages the Lab manager to retrieve configuration information\n",
    "- Creates clients for all managers used in a MADSci experiment\n",
    "- Provides utility functions that make it easier to run experiments and handle data locally\n",
    "- Can operate as Nodes, allowing you to incorporate custom functionality into workflows, including data processing and AI control\n",

    "### Built-in Client Access\n",

    "- `workcell_client`: Workflow coordination and scheduling  \n",
