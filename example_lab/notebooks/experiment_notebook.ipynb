    "The MADSci software architecture uses a number of modular components, called managers, to organize the workflows, resources and datapoints that we will use to actually do science. In order to interface with the manager, we provide clients with predefined functions that make the manager functionality easy to understand and use. The `ExperimentApplication` class provided by MADSci leverages the Lab manager to retrieve configuration information and create clients for all managers used in a MADSci experiment. It also provides some utility functions that make it easier to run experiments and handle data locally. Finally, `ExperimentApplication`s are able to operate as Nodes, allowing you to incorporate custom functionality into workflows, including data processing and AI control"
